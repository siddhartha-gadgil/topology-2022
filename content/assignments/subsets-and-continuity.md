1. Let `$A$` be the subset of the Cantor set `$X$` (recall this is defined as `$\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$` with an ultra-metric) with `$A$` consisting of sequences `$\{a_n\}$` such that  `$a_n= 0$` for all but finitely many `$n$`. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. `$A$` is open in `$X$`.
    2. `$A$` is closed in `$X$`.
    3. `$A$` intersects every open set in `$X$`.

2. Prove or disprove the following.
    1. A subspace of a space with discrete topology has discrete topology.
    2. A subspace of a space with indiscrete topology has indiscrete topology.
    3. A subspace of a space with cofinite topology has cofinite topology.

3. Let `$Y$` be a topological space such that for all topological spaces `$X$`, every map `$f: X\to Y$` is continuous. Prove that `$Y$` has the indiscrete topology.
