1. For each of the following collections of subsets of `$\R^2$`, prove or disprove that they form the basis for a topology on `$\R^2$`.
    - __(a)__ `$\{ (a, b) \times (c, d) \subset \R^2 : a, b, c, d\in \R, a < b, c < d \}$`.
    - __(b)__ `$\{ (a, b) \times (c, d) \subset \R^2 : a, b, c, d\in \R, a < b, c < d - 1 \}$`.
    - __(c)__ `$\{ (a, b) \times (c, d) \subset \R^2 : a, b, c, d\in \Q, a < b, c < d \}$`.
    - __(d)__ `$\{ (a, b) \times \R \subset \R^2 : a, b\in \R, a < b \}$`.

2. For each pair of collections of sets in the above question which form a basis for a topology on `$\R^2$`, prove or disprove that the topologies they generate are equal.
