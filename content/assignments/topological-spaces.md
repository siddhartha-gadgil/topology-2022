1. Let `$X=\{1, 2\}$`. What is the number of collections of subsets `$\Omega\subset 2^X$` that form a topology on `$X$?` Prove your answer.

2. Let `$X=\Z$` and let `$\Omega = \{V\subset \Z : \text{the set $\N\setminus V$ is finite}\} \cup \{\phi\}$`. Prove or disprove that `$\Omega$` is a topology on `$X$`.
